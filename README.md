SQL - Homework assignment #9

Following are notes that are intendned to clarify the methodology used during the query and bonus excercises.
1.  List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, gender, and salary.
    - As the instrucitons requested this data was pulled from the employees table.  It should be noted that further inspection of the data       revealed that this tale includes both past and present employees not just current employees.
  
2.  List employees who were hired in 1986.
    - Data was pulled form the employees table.  As in the abovie query there was no filter applied to drop past employees so resaults           represent strictly any employee list in the employees table.
   
3.  List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number,     last name, first name, and start and end employment dates.
    - This query represents the current manager of each department.  Following the first query it was noticed that the data represented           both past and present managers.  A filter was added by use of a WHERE command that called for only rows containing the year 9999 in         the to_date column witin the dept_manager table to accomplish this.
    
4.  List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
    - This query represents department each current employee contained in the employees table currently holds.  The data contained in the         dept_emp table represents both current and historical data.  A filter was added by use of a WHERE command that called for only rows         containing the year 9999 in the to_date column witin the dept_emp table to accomplish this.
  
5.  List all employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B".
    - This query was generated by use of a WHERE statement and wildcard to return the instances of a last name begining with "B".
    
6.  List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
    - This query returns all emplyees currently serving in the Sales department.  Again as in previous queries a WHERE statment filtering         out any past employees was utilized.
    
7.  List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department         name.
    - This query is essentialy the same as #6 but included an additional goup of employees currently working in Development.
    
8.  In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.
    - This query retuned the frequency of each last name contained in the employees table, it was then sorted greatest to least similar           last names.  The most similar name was found to be Baba, and the least similar is Foolsday (Sounds like a joke to me?).
